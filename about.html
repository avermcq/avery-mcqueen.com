    <p>
      I’m Avery McQueen, a Business Operations and Program Management consultant who helps high-touch teams run cleaner, faster, and with more confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work sits at the intersection of luxury real estate, data, and operations. I partner with developers, marketing and sales teams, and membership and event organizations to design structured workflows, build dashboards leadership can actually rely on, and streamline reporting across cross-functional teams—without diluting the brand experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across client engagements, I’m typically brought in when things feel fragmented, manual, or overly dependent on a few people “holding it all in their head.”
      I create systems that make execution easier: KPI and pipeline reporting, milestone tracking, forecasting support, and workflow automation across CRM and productivity platforms
      so teams spend less time chasing updates and more time moving work forward. I’ve supported multiple real estate groups—including developer teams and a luxury brokerage new development team—translating complex inventory and sales activity into polished, client-ready outputs and dependable internal visibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before consulting, I led business operations for a multi-project real estate portfolio, coordinating across sales, finance, construction, and marketing while owning reporting and dashboards that improved clarity and speed of decision-making.
      Earlier in my career, I led large-scale event operations—managing scheduling, staffing, vendor coordination, and real-time issue resolution—which built a strong foundation in logistics, stakeholder management, and calm execution under pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hold a Master’s in Data Science and bring a systems mindset to everything I touch, combining analytical rigor with operational practicality.
      My strengths include program and project management, process improvement, forecasting and resource planning, dashboards and reporting, CRM and workflow automation,
      and clear communication across cross-functional teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the core, I care about two things: protecting the brand experience and protecting the team’s time.
      I build structure that feels premium on the front end—and runs efficiently behind the scenes.
